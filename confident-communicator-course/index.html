            <p>You’ve been heads down. You’ve put in long hours. You’re starting to feel like you deserve to be recognized for your efforts.</p>
            <p>You're waiting for someone to recognize all your hard work.</p>
			<p>And then it happens...</p>
            <p>The project you wanted goes to someone else. Or worse... a promotion!</p>
            <p>You could continue to stay heads down and hope your peers and boss will recognize your efforts.</p>
            <p>Or you could speak, share your expertise, and have people take notice of the work you’ve done!</p>
            <p>A huge part of career success comes down to your communication skills: sharing your experiences and expertise. When you speak, people take notice and opportunities come to you. If you don’t speak up, opportunities will fly by.

            <p>You’re concerned about what to say, how to say it, and if anyone will bother listening.</p>
            <p>You’re unsure about your expertise and how to speak authentically, using your own voice and style. But you DO have knowledge worth sharing. You’re not an impostor-- you deserve to be heard!</p>

              <p>Each week students will attend classes which are taught via live video. Recordings will also be provided. Students are to attend classes, and complete weekly exercises that get submitted for instructor feedback. Homework will often consist of students recording themselves speaking on a topic.</p>
              <h3 class="text-green">Online labs</h3>
              <p>Instructors will hold labs once a week for 90 minutes. Students are encouraged to attend labs to connect with instructors and receive live feedback on their presentations. All lab sessions will be recorded and the recordings will be made available for students.</p>

              <strong>How is  Confident Communicator better than a free workshop or in-house coach?</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>Free workshops and coaches are great, but we offer a lot more individualized attention than any other course. You’ll get personalized feedback from our experienced instructors in a small classroom setting, and you’ll even get a buddy to hold you accountable. You’ll learn from the feedback the instructors give not only to you but to the other students as well. We have a lab, and we request that you complete assignments, to ensure you’re making progress along the way. We’re in the tech space, so unlike many other options, our methods are zeroed in on your industry.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>Although our course is online, it is THE equivalent to having an in-house speaking coach for your company, just more convenient because you can attend whether you’re in San Francisco, Houston, or Hong Kong. You won’t be watching boring video recordings—our course is interactive and will simulate the experience of a live talk. You’ll get lots of practice that will be applicable.</p>

              <p>Alex Kazakov has been passionate about technology for as long as he can remember.</p>

<p>Now CTO of Glownet, a now 25-person company that makes RFID wristband technology for the event industry, he is often called upon as a mentor and coach to fellow engineers who rely on him for guidance and leadership—often to pursue new business challenges for the first time.</p>

<p>Since the earliest days of his career as a developer and now as a product owner who manages a team of developers, Alex has always gravitated towards opportunities to be a leader and coach. As a recognized role model, he has even presented at (and won) one of the largest business competitions in Russia.</p> 

<p>But Alex felt that his accomplishments weren’t enough—he knew that he had room to improve. In his growth as a leader, Alex has amassed a wealth of firsthand expertise in the field of human technology. But unlike previous roles in which he was an individual contributor, he is now responsible for managing complex, cross-functional teams to achieve goals that sometimes don't have a path forward—he found himself needing a better way to communicate his ideas across these groups.</p>

              <p>Tammy was tired of being nervous—it was the one challenge that she felt held her back from sharing her expertise as a leader, as well as opportunities for her to share her unique insight at conferences and industry panels.</p>

<p>Her challenge boiled down to a classic case of imposter syndrome—the deceptive feeling of not having ‘earned’ or ‘deserving of’ certain achievements. Even with 10+ years as a user experience designer (with many accomplishments under her belt), Tammy didn’t feel like an expert. When called on to lead a presentation, conduct a usability test with a customer, or share her expertise during a job interview, she’d get scared. And making things worse, other people were noticing.</p>

<p>“I’d get feedback saying that I seemed nervous or talked too formally,” she explains.</p>
