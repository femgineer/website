                        <h2>Our Difference</h2>
                        <h3>You're a maker and doer at heart, but you're buried under an avalanche of ideas. Maybe you're stuck, obsessing over ideas, worried about money, or mulling over questions like "should I quit my day job?" or "should I build a web or mobile app?"</h3>
                        <p>
                          These are the questions that stop entrepreneurs dead in their tracks -- preventing amazing ideas from coming to life, as a result.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We've seen far too many entrepreneurs give up too early or chase the wrong direction. We've also identified the steps you can take to outsmart these uncertainties. With our course, you'll be set up for an amzing entrepreneurial or product development career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We're proud to see our alumni go on to launch paid products, raise capital from angel investors, run successful crowdfunding campaigns, and get accepted into accelerators.

                                  <p>Alyssa Ravasio, Founder &amp; CEO of HipCamp - a platform that makes it easy to discover and book awesome camp sites - used the lessons that she learned from Femgineer to find early adopters, launch a prototype, and raise $1M in angel funding for her startup.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Femgineer's Ship It course pushed Ravasio out of her comfort zone to seek customer feedback much earlier than she was ready. With only a prototype in hand, she was nervous about what others would think. But Femgineer forced her to move faster and to get her product into the hands of her customers.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    "Going through a lot of these usability interviews, I've learned to ask open-ended questions instead of specific ones. For example, I would ask - what is your biggest challenge when camping? I've received so much unexpected feedback on that one question."
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    As part of the Ship It course, Alyssa was able to do more than develop her product - she was able to identify a critical flaw in some of her early business assumptions. Initially, she built her prototype around the assumption that her customers had no familiariy with the state parks around them. She even wrote code to help audiences find state parks close to their cities.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    But Alyssa's early prototype helped her see that her target customers already knew where they wanted to camp - they just needed a little bit of help finding the right place.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    She was also surprised to learn that her customers didn't need a bunch of complicated features - they already found her prototype useful.
                                  </p>

                                    A key lesson that she learned was the importance of the customer feedback process and how to do better research and reduce time to market.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    "In  the course of doing all the exercises for the hands-on labs, I realized that we weren't thinking correctly about our target market. Poornima taught us how to structure that feedback from our potential customers and how to use that feedback constructively. If I had gone out and done it myself, I wouldn't have had an effective approach as well as a proper way to segment them."

                                    In other words? She realized that stepping in the wrong direction would be better than not taking a step at all - a lesson that she keeps close to heart as she continues to advance in her career.

And if you don't know how to code, then we'll teach you how to recruit people who do!</p>
                                <p><strong>If you're looking for a get-rich-quick scheme,</strong> this program isn't for you either. It will put you on the fast track to bringing your products to life, but you still have to do the exercises included in order to reap the benefits, which will take some time. How much time depends on your level of productivity. It also comes down to how the market responds to your product.</p>
                                <p><strong>If you're trying to build something for a very niche segment,</strong> then chances are it will take time to find and attract a base of early adopters who understand your product's benefits.</p>
                                <p><strong>If you're not ready to invest in your learning.</strong> We know what it's like to be strapped for cash, and to have other financial commitments!
